## Project Overview

This web application helps employers create high-quality, inclusive, and structured job descriptions (JDs) using AI.  
It provides two main workflows:

1. **Optimize Existing Job Description**  
   - Upload DOCX, PDF, or TXT files.  
   - AI analyzes and scores the JD with categorized suggestions: Critical, Recommended, and Nice-to-Have.  
   - Users can apply, skip, and preview optimized JDs.

2. **Smart Builder (AI Generation)**  
   - Generate a professional JD from basic details: title, location, and employment type.  
   - AI produces a ready-to-post, inclusive job description automatically.

**Key Benefits:**  
- Saves time and improves JD quality.  
- Reduces bias using AI-driven language analysis.  
- Enhances candidate matching accuracy.  
- Provides practical AI and full-stack development experience.
